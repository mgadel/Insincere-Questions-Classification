# Insincere-Questions-Classification
Submittion to Kaggle "Quora Insincere Questions Classification" challenge :

"
In this competition you will be predicting whether a question asked on Quora is sincere or not.

An insincere question is defined as a question intended to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers. Some characteristics that can signify that a question is insincere:

Has a non-neutral tone
Is disparaging or inflammatory
Isn't grounded in reality
Uses sexual content (incest, bestiality, pedophilia) for shock value, and not to seek genuine answers

The training data includes the question that was asked, and whether it was identified as insincere (target = 1). The ground-truth labels contain some amount of noise: they are not guaranteed to be perfect.
